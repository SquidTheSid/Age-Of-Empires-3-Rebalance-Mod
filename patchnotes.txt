SquidTheSid & Dansil92's unit rebalance mod

#The goal of this mod is to rebalance the units of problematic civilizations. This is aimed to encourage greater unit diversity and bring underperforming units up to par by often giving them new/interesting roles.

- Philosopher Prince: Age up cost reduced to 700 food, now ships 400 food (down from 500).

Fortress Politician Reworks/Changes: Incorporated many of Smackdown's ideas to improve lesser used politicians.

Gatling gun: In RE, it's just a worse organ gun. I've buffed it to have parity with that.
- Damage: raised to 33 from 30
- LOS: increased to 30 from 26
- Range: increased to 26 from 24 
- HP: increased to 200 from 150

- Speed: increased to 4.5 from 4.0.
- Armor: Increased to 20% hand from 10% hand 

Imam/Priest: Do you ever see them? Healing as a mechanic in AoE3 is pretty terrible, so I'm making Priests cheaper and a bit faster to make them decent meatshields
- Cost: Reduced to 70F/G, down from 200 gold. Bounty adjusted accordingly (20 --> 14); Missionary cost reduced to 80W/G from 100W/G. Bounty adjusted accordingly (20 --> 16)

Aztec: 

Aztec can now build a single Nobles' Hut in colonial age (but it cannot train any units), this is raised to 7 (RE cap) on fortress age.

Warrior Priest - no longer costs population (gives more flexibility for Aztec's lategame army) 

Politician Changes:
- Shaman: instead of granting a HP/Damage bonus to war/noble huts, now provides Warrior Priests. 1 in Colonial and Fortress ages and 2 in Industrial and Imperial ages (additionally provide +5/10% gather rates to fire pits as well). 
- Chief: Now additionally provides 3/6/9/12 Pet Janey Jaguars
- Warrior: Skull Knights additionally train 15/25/40% faster

	-- Industrial Age gather rate bonus improved to 15% from 10%

Jaguar Prowl Knight - The JPK is now a melee skirmisher, similar to India's Urumi, but without AoE. His heavy infantry tag has been removed, but he's much weaker vs. cavalry to compensate. 
- HP: Lowered to 200 from 230
- Siege: Lowered to 24 Siege Damage from 36
- Armor: Changed from 10% melee to 20% ranged
- 0.75x multiplier vs Cavalry and CoyoteMan added (with a further 0.75x vs light infantry), 2.0x light cavalry multiplier/xpEagleKnight multipliers added
- Heavy infantry unit tag removed
- Quetzalcoatl Temple Support now ships 11 JPK instead of 18; cost reduced to 1000 gold.

Skull Knight - The Skull Knight is now a mini-cuirassier and is classified as light infantry. They're Aztec's shock troopers and their AoE cleave can carve through skirmishers with ease. To compensate for their increased speed, they have lower siege damage and no unit multipliers. 
- Armor: Changed from 20% melee to 20% ranged
- 3x Cavalry and 2x Light Infantry damage multipliers removed (no penalties/strengths vs. any unit now)
- Speed: Increased from 4 to 6.25
- Siege: Reduced to 20 damage from 72; now affected by Scorched Earth shipment
- Infantry and Heavy Infantry unit tags removed, Light Infantry and CoyoteMan unit tags added
- Damage Cap: Reduced to 40 from 68

Eagle Runner Knight - Due to the increased versatility of the Aztec army, ERKs have had their power levels slightly brought down in general, but are better vs artillery. (Incorporating Garja's changes)
- 1.25x AbstractArtillery damage multiplier added.
- Armor: Reduced from 30% ranged to 20% 
- Speed: Increased to 6.25 from 6.00

Arrow Knights - Very underwhelming as anti-artillery and anti-building units, as they deal little damage to cannons and are one-shot by falconets.
- HP: Increased to 160 from 150
- Artillery Damage multiplier increased to 8x from 5x
- Movement Speed: Increased from 3.75 to 4 
- Siege: Increased to 50 from 36
- Cost: Increased to 70F and 100G from 50F and 75G. 

Puma Spearmen - Incorporating standardized pikeman changes.
- Melee range increased to 1.0
- Light Infantry damage multiplier improved to 3.5x
- Xochipilli Temple Support now ships 7 Puma Spearmen instead of 12; cost reduced to 500 gold.

Macehaultin - Incorporated ESOC changes
- Centeotl Support now additionally increases range and LOS by 2 each. 
- Centeotl Support now ships 11 Macehaultin instead of 18; cost reduced to 500 gold. 

Coyote Runner: Coyotes Struggle later on, so I've made them beefier and their temple card cheaper to help them out. Due to unit tag changes, they should also be a bit more durable to skirmishers now. 
- HP: Increased to 160 from 150
- Coyote Combat HP bonus increased to 25% from 20
- 1.5x AbstractSiegeTrooper damage multiplier added. This is to help with gren and mantlet spam
- Xipe Totec Support now ships 6 Coyote Runners instead of 11; cost reduced to 500 gold. 

Janey Jaguars: The temple shipment is way too expensive for an age 4 card, especially since Janeys aren't amazing cav substitutes. 
- Tezcatlipoca Temple shipment cost reduced to 1000 gold from 1500; Religious Unity shipment reduces cost to 500
- Tezcatlipoza Temple shipment HP/damage bonus increased to 50% from 35%.

War Chief: With the speed improvements to Skull Knights and ERKs, I've buffed smoking mirror to compensate
- Smoking Mirror Shipment increases speed by 40% instead of 35%

Shipments: 
- New Ways. Allows Aztec to research Military Drummers, Country Infantry Rifling, and Infantry Breatplate. Also grants Aztec 3 unique economic upgrades: 2 wood trickles (distributivism in colonial and foreign logging in fortress) and a 30% boost to coin gather rates at the plantation. 
- Cheap War Huts cost reduction improved to 60% from 50% 

Overall: Aztec's vanilla roster was heavily weighted in favor of anti-cav, with Jaguar Prowl Knights, Puma Spearmen, Skull Knights, and Eagle Runner Knights all fulfilling this role. Generally, a late-game Aztec player would build their army out of almost entirely ERKs due to their significant overall strength, leaving Skull Knights and JPK by the wayside. Now, Aztec have 2 proper cavalry units, 2 skirmisher units, 2 anti-cav units, and 1 artillery unit. 

Sioux :

Teepee: A very controversial building (given how ESOC added then removed an economic aura a la karni mata).
- Aura: AOE increased to 18 from 12
- Cost: Reduced to 40W from 50, bounties adjusted accordingly (20/10 --> 16/8)
- HP: Increased to 400 from 300

- Sioux can now build regular walls in the Industrial Age (cannot be upgraded)
- Sioux's town centers cost 400 wood instead of 500 [ESOC]

Politician Reworks/Changes:
- Wise woman: now ships more bison (8,15,25, 40 up from 6,12,20,30) and grants a larger buff to hunting (20/30/40/50% up from 10/20/30/40%)
- Warrior: Colonial Age now ships 2 Axe Riders (up from 1). Industrial Age ships 3 Dog Soldiers, and Imperial ships 6 Dog Soldiers.

Shipments: 
- Earth Bounty shipment moved to colonial age and now provides 1.25 Food, Wood, and Gold trickles instead of 0.65 Wood and Gold trickles
- Burnt Thigh Support Shipment now sends 8 Rifle Riders (up from 7) and 2 aztec warrior priests instead of medicine men
- Lakota Support now ships 8 axe riders (up from 7) and 15 bison (up from 9)
- Nakota Support now ships 5 Dog Soldiers instead of 4
- San Arc Support no longer ships wood, but increases the hitpoints of all War Clubs by 20%
- Oglala Support no longer ships food, but increases the damage of all Cetan Bows by 20%
- Dakota Support now ships 6 Tashunke Prowlers (up from 5) and increases the hitpoints of all Tashunke Prowlers by 30% (up from 25%)
- Bandit Gang - Bandit Gang (Non-repeatable) renamed to Outlaw Combat and no longer ships units nor costs coin. Instead, it increases the HP/damage of Outlaw Comanchero, Outlaw Riflemen, and Outlaw Pistolero by 35% and cost 2 less population
- Three Sisters - Age 4 Shipment that increases farm gather rate by 40% (currently replaces old ways)
- Cav combat cards affect Tashunke Prowlers by an extra 5% (for a total of 20% each)
- Aggressive policy now reduces the cost of Teepees by 50% and build time by 40%, but reduces their hitpoints by 50%, in addition to letting infantry build War Huts, Teepees, and Corrals
- Nomadic Expansion cost reduction reduced to 25% from 30%, hitpoint increase reduced to 25% from 50%. Now additionally increases Teepee LOS by 5. Now available in Age 1
- Sioux now has access to the water dance shipment
- Adoption train time reduction improved to -40% from -25% [ESOC]
- Onikare moved to Age 4 from Age 2; now additionally reduces Dog Soldier train time by 20% [thanks to gamevideo113]
- 4 villager shipment increased to 5

Bow Rider - They're pretty ridiculous on RE, so I've incorporated Garja's HP nerf
- HP: Reduced to 230 from 250
- Cost: Reduced to 100F/70G from 100F/75G

Tashunke Prowler - Arguably the worst and weirdest unit in the game. Their overall design is terrible, and the buff in numbers is a terrible mechanic. Combined with their stealth (which only carded coyote runners share) and AoE, and this is a unit that is massively conflicted in design. They've been buffed significantly across the board and have been given a new role to help round out a specific weakness of the Sioux. 
- HP: Increased to 200 from 170
- Armor: Ranged armor increased to 30% from 10%
- Damage: Base attack increased to 20 from 15
- 5x Hero, 5x mercenary, and 2.5x native unit damage multipliers added. 
- LOS increased to 18 from 12
- Marauders shipment additionally increased LOS by 6. 
- Cavalry Damage/Hitpoint shipments buff Tashunke Prowlers by 20% instead of 15 (like Chinese Flamethrowers)

War Club - War Clubs are the Sioux's equivalent of pikemen, except they're not particularly great vs. cavalry or buildings. Since Sioux have access to Bow Riders age 2, anti-cav isn't usually a problem, but the lack of siege is. Therefore, I've made them deal far more siege damage, in addition to being a bit tankier and hit harder. Now, they're roughly equivalent to the Aztec's Puma Spearmen, but with slightly less damage and slightly more HP
-HP: Increased from 120 to 140
- Damage: Base attack increased to 11 from 10
- Siege: Increased to 35 damage from 27
- Cost: Increased to 55F/40W from 50F/40W

Cetan Bow: Incorporated ESOC Changes
- HP: Increased to 100 from 90
- Speed: Increased to 4.5 from 4.0


Overall, Tashunke Prowlers are now the cavalry equivalent of spies, but with a splash attack and an aura gimmick. They still require heavy resource investment to maximize, but they should be usable in small numbers, no longer being completely outclassed by the cheap steppe rider. While they might not see use in every game, they're no longer a joke unit. War Clubs help provide the raw siege damage that Sioux lacks early on, and Cetan Bows are more versatile archer units, especially with their reworked mercenary shipments. Outlaw units are situationally more useful in lategame now, thanks to a buffed repeatable Bandit Gang, and Outlaw Combat replacing the non repeatable variant (combining the effects of European's Wild West saloon tech and Dance Hall population reduction)

Iroquois:


Secondary civ bonus: economic buildings now generate resource trickles but are more expensive to construct.
- Market cost increased to 180 from 100; built limit set to 5; generates 0.5 Wood/s
- Plantation cost increased to 650 from 500; build limit set to 6; generates 0.75 Gold/s
- Farm cost increased to 525 from 400; build limit set to 6; generates 1.0 Food/s

Crates of 200 F/W/C increased to 300 Food and 300 Wood.

Politician Reworks/Changes: Incorporating some of smackdown's buffs
- Wise Woman: Industrial Age ships 500 Food/400 Wood/400 Coin (up by 100 each); Imperial Age ships 800 Food/700 Wood/700 Coin (up by 200 food and 100 gold/wood)
- Chief: Now ships 3 villagers in colonial (from 2); 6 villagers in fortress (from 4); and 12 villagers in industrial (from 10)
- Warrior: Colonial Age now additionally ships 2 tomahawks; Industrial now additionally ships 2 rams. 

Big Buttons:
- Siege Drill Big Button cost reduced to 350 food/gold from 500 food/gold.
- Lacrosse Big Buttoncost reduced to 500 Wood/Gold from 600.
- Horse Secrets Big Button cost reduced to 350 Wood/Gold from 400.
- Secret Society Big Button cost reduced to 100 Wood/Gold from 200 Wood, 100 Gold.

[Garja] Aenna and Forest Prowler HP reduced to 100 from 110 

Mantlet: They're fantastic units, but their slow movement speed really hampers their use. Bumping it up to 4.0 makes them much more versatile units.
- Speed: Increased to 4.0 from 3.5

Ram: They're niche units, and the slow movement speed doesn't help. Normalizing it to 4 alongside mantlets makes Iro's army far more mobile
- Speed: Increased to 4.0 from 3.5

Tomahawk: though they get a lot of upgrades, they have a pretty terrible base attack for a musketeer (being slightly better than a rusket, without being cheaper) and are very expensive. 
- Ranged Damage increased to 20 from 19

Shipments:
- Tuscarora Support now ships 2 Warrior priests instead of medicine men
- 6 Musket Rider shipment increased to 7 (Terrible age IV shipment resourcewise)
- Age 4 Cavalry Combat shipment added. (helps with their mediocre lategame kanya)

- War Houses now additionally increases Longhouse HP by 25%
- TEAM Cheap Outposts cost reduction increased to 60% from 30%



India:

Agra Fort: A very unbalanced wonder. Obscenely powerful for an age 2 building, yet terrible later on in the game. As a result damage has been nerfed to make it less formidable (letting siege infantry actually have a chance), and it's more powerful lategame if you delay building it in colonial
- HP: 5000; now scales up by 1000 when built each age, starting from Age IV (6k industrial, 7k imperial). NOTE: a colonial agra doesn't shadowtech to 7k from 5k. It must be built to transition to imperial for full value.
- Damage: Base damage reduced to 20 from 25. 
	-- Ranged attack now scales by 30 in fortress age and 25 when built each age thereafter (50 fortress, 75 industrial, 100 imperial). NOTE: a colonial agra doesn't shadowtech to 100 damage from 20. It must be built to transition to imperial for full value.
	-- Anti-Ship attack now scales up to 80/150/225/300 (same rules apply as the ranged attack regarding scaling).
- Delhi Gate tech and Red Fort techs now increase attack and HP by 25% in each (as opposed to 50% and 50% each)
- Advanced Wonders now only increases Agra Fort HP by ~30%  (1.5 base plus a 0.80 multiplier)

Sacred Field: Very underwhelming for India's XP source. Too expensive for what yield it gives.
- Cost: Wood cost reduced to 200 from 250
- Goraksha and Sacred Syllable shipments now additionally ship 2 sacred cows.
- Sacred Syllable heal rate increased to 15 from 8

Ottoman Consulate LOS bonus reduced to 8 from 10
Exalted (Imperial) Infantry and Camel upgrades now additionally reduces train time by 20%.

Flail Elephants: Awful redundant units. needs a complete overhaul, but I've just given them some buffs in the meantime.
- Infantry multiplier increased to 3.0x from 1.5x
- Villager damage penalty removed. 
- Population Cost: Reduced to 4 from 3 (mansabdar reduced to 6)
- Speed: Increased to 4.5 from 4.0

Sepoy: The best colonial age musketeer. They're a bit too strong, I find, so their HP has been slightly lowered to adjust Town Center fire breakpoints (7 vills now 3 shot a sepoy instead of 8).
- HP: Lowered to 185 from 190

Rajput: Infamously terrible on vanilla, they're pretty much a worse version of Sepoy. To help them out, I've incorporated ESOC's changes
- Siege: Increased to 25 damage up from 20
- Speed: Increased to 5.5 from 5.0 

Siege Elephant: Siege elephants struggled greatly on vanilla due to being easily overwhelmed by infantry. With the removal of their light cav tag, they should be more versatile units.
- Light cavalry unit tag removed
- Population Cost: Reduced to 6 from 7
- Honored upgrade increases artillery multiplier to 3.5x from 2.5x
- Honored upgrade increases range to 30 from 28
- LOS increased to 34 from 29
- Removed villager damage penalty
- Mansabdar population cost reduced to 9 from 14

Mahout Lancer: In vanilla, Mahout are easily kited, making them very hard to use. They've been buffed to make them better at chasing down skirmishers.
- Population Cost: Reduced to 6 from 7
- Speed: Increased to 6.25 from 6
- Range: Melee range increased to 2
- Removed villager damage penalty
- Damage: Melee attack improved to 35 from 28
- Mansabdar population cost reduced to 9 from 14

Howdah: Howdah, much like Mahout, as slow and are population inefficient. They've been adjusted as such
- Population Cost: Reduced to 5 from 6
- Speed: Increased to 6 from 5.5
- Mansabdar population cost reduced to 8 from 12
