SquidTheSid & Dansil92's unit rebalance mod

#The goal of this mod is to rebalance the units of problematic civilizations. This is aimed to encourage greater unit diversity and bring underperforming units up to par by often giving them new/interesting roles.

- LOS: increased to 30 from 26
- Range: increased to 26 from 24 
- HP: increased to 200 from 150

- Speed: increased to 4.5 from 4.0.
- Armor: Increased to 20% hand from 10% hand 

Imam/Priest: Do you ever see them? Healing as a mechanic in AoE3 is pretty terrible, so I'm making Priests cheaper and a bit faster to make them decent meatshields

Warrior Priest - no longer costs population (gives more flexibility for Aztec's lategame army) 

New Building Added: Great Temple
Cost: 500 Food/Wood/Gold
Build Time: 60 Seconds
HP: 4500
Effect: Generates 7.5 gold/s while alive. 
Age: IV

Politician Changes:
- Shaman: instead of granting a HP/Damage bonus to war/noble huts, now provides Warrior Priests. 1 in Colonial and Fortress ages and 2 in Industrial and Imperial ages (additionally provide +5/10% gather rates to fire pits as well). 
- Chief: Now additionally provides 3/6/9/12 Pet Janey Jaguars

	-- Industrial Age gather rate bonus improved to 15% from 10%

Jaguar Prowl Knight - The JPK is now a melee skirmisher, similar to Urumi, but without AoE. His heavy infantry tag has been removed, but he's much weaker vs. cavalry to compensate. 
- HP: Lowered to 200 from 230
- Siege: Lowered to 24 Siege Damage from 36
- Armor: Changed from 10% melee to 20% ranged
- 0.75x multiplier vs Cavalry and CoyoteMan added (with a further 0.75x vs light infantry), 2.0x light cavalry multiplier/xpEagleKnight multipliers added
- Heavy infantry unit tag removed
- Quetzalcoatl Temple Support now ships 11 JPK instead of 18; cost reduced to 1000 gold.

Skull Knight - The Skull Knight is now a mini-cuirassier and is classified as light infantry. They're Aztec's shock troopers and their AoE cleave can carve through skirmishers with ease. To compensate for their increased speed, they have lower siege damage and no unit multipliers. 
- Armor: Changed from 20% melee to 20% ranged
- 3x Cavalry and 2x Light Infantry damage multipliers removed (no penalties/strengths vs. any unit now)
- Speed: Increased from 4 to 6.25
- Siege: Reduced to 20 damage from 72; now affected by Scorched Earth shipment
- Infantry and Heavy Infantry unit tags removed, Light Infantry and CoyoteMan unit tags added
- Damage Cap: Reduced to 40 from 68

Eagle Runner Knight - Due to the increased versatility of the Aztec army, ERKs have had their power levels slightly brought down in general, but are better vs artillery. (Incorporating Garja's changes)
- 1.25x AbstractArtillery damage multiplier added.
- Armor: Reduced from 30% ranged to 20% 
- Speed: Increased to 6.25 from 6.00

Arrow Knights - Very underwhelming as anti-artillery and anti-building units, as they deal little damage to cannons and are one-shot by falconets.
- HP: Increased to 160 from 150
- Artillery Damage multiplier increased to 8x from 5x
- Movement Speed: Increased from 3.75 to 4 
- Siege: Increased to 50 from 36
- Cost: Increased to 70F and 100G from 50F and 75G. 

Puma Spearmen - Incorporating standardized pikeman changes.
- Melee range increased to 1.0
- Light Infantry damage multiplier improved to 3.5x
- Xochipilli Temple Support now ships 7 Puma Spearmen instead of 12; cost reduced to 500 gold.

Macehaultin - Incorporated ESOC changes
- Centeotl Support now additionally increases range and LOS by 2 each. 
- Centeotl Support now ships 11 Macehaultin instead of 18; cost reduced to 500 gold. 

Coyote Runner: Coyotes Struggle later on, so I've made them beefier and their temple card cheaper to help them out. Due to unit tag changes, they should also be a bit more durable to skirmishers now. 
- HP: Increased to 160 from 150
- Coyote Combat HP bonus increased to 25% from 20
- 1.5x AbstractSiegeTrooper damage multiplier added. This is to help with gren and mantlet spam
- Xipe Totec Support now ships 6 Coyote Runners instead of 11; cost reduced to 500 gold. 

Janey Jaguars: The temple shipment is way too expensive for an age 4 card, especially since Janeys aren't amazing cav substitutes. 
- Tezcatlipoca Temple shipment cost reduced to 1000 gold from 1500; Religious Unity shipment reduces cost to 500
- Tezcatlipoza Temple shipment HP/damage bonus increased to 50% from 35%.

War Chief: With the speed improvements to Skull Knights and ERKs, I've buffed smoking mirror to compensate
- Smoking Mirror Shipment increases speed by 40% instead of 35%

Shipments: 
- New Ways. Allows Aztec to research Military Drummers, Country Infantry Rifling, and Infantry Breatplate. Also grants Aztec 3 unique economic upgrades: 2 wood trickles (distributivism in colonial and foreign logging in fortress) and a 30% boost to coin gather rates at the plantation. 
- Cheap War Huts cost reduction improved to 60% from 50% 

Overall: Aztec's vanilla roster was heavily weighted in favor of anti-cav, with Jaguar Prowl Knights, Puma Spearmen, Skull Knights, and Eagle Runner Knights all fulfilling this role. Generally, a late-game Aztec player would build their army out of almost entirely ERKs due to their significant overall strength, leaving Skull Knights and JPK by the wayside. Now, Aztec have 2 proper cavalry units, 2 skirmisher units, 2 anti-cav units, and 1 artillery unit. 

Sioux :

+1 Starting villager added. 

Teepee: A very controversial building (given how ESOC added then removed an economic aura a la karni mata).
- Aura: AOE increased to 16 from 12
- Cost: Reduced to 25F/25W from 50 Wood

Civ Bonus Changes:
- Sioux get free bison every Age (4 colonial, 8 fortress, 16 industrial, 30 imperial)
- Sioux can now build regular walls in the Industrial Age (Bastion becomes available in Imperial Age)
- Sioux's town centers cost 400 wood instead of 500 [ESOC]
- Sioux infantry gain +10% increased siege damage each age, starting in discovery age. 

Fire Pit Changes:

- Warrior: Colonial Age now ships 2 Axe Riders (up from 1). Industrial Age ships 3 Dog Soldiers, and Imperial ships 6 Dog Soldiers.


Bow Rider - They're pretty ridiculous on RE, so I've incorporated EP'/DE's HP nerf, but with an armor buff to help compensate
- HP: Reduced to 225 from 250
- Amor: Improved to 40% melee from 30%

Tashunke Prowler - Arguably the worst and weirdest unit in the game. Their overall design is terrible, and the buff in numbers is a terrible mechanic. Combined with their stealth (which only carded coyote runners share) and AoE, and this is a unit that is massively conflicted in design. I've reworked them into being tanky siege cav, kind of like flail elephants, but much faster (and less tanky). 
- Now shadowtechs by 25% in the fortress age, and Industrial/Imperial unit upgrades added. 
- Cost: Reduced to 100 Food/100 Gold from 150 Food/75 Gold
- HP: Increased to 240 from 170

- LOS: Increased to 18 from 12
- Speed: Reduced to 6.5 from 6.75
- No longer enters stealth by default. 

War Club - War Clubs are the Sioux's equivalent of pikemen, except they're not particularly great vs. cavalry or buildings. Since Sioux have access to Bow Riders age 2, anti-cav isn't usually a problem, but the lack of siege is. Therefore, I've made them deal far more siege damage, in addition to hitting a bit harder.
- Melee: Improved to 11 from 10
- Siege: Increased to 30 damage from 27

Cetan Bow: Incorporated ESOC Changes
- HP: Increased to 100 from 90
- Speed: Increased to 4.5 from 4.0

Shipments: 
- Earth Bounty shipment moved to colonial age and now provides 1.25 Food, Wood, and Gold trickles instead of 0.65 Wood and Gold trickles

- Nakota Support now ships 5 Dog Soldiers instead of 4
- San Arc Support no longer ships wood, but increases the hitpoints of all War Clubs by 25% and their armor by +0.10 (30% net melee resist)
- Oglala Support no longer ships food, but increases the siege range of Cetan Bows by +10 (from 6 to 16) and triples their siege damage (via a 3x building multiplier, like Seminole Guerilla Wars).
- Dakota Support now ships 6 Tashunke Prowlers (up from 5), increases their attack by 20%, and lets them use stealth. 
- Bandit Gang - Bandit Gang (Non-repeatable) renamed to Outlaw Combat and no longer ships units nor costs coin. Instead, it increases the HP/damage of Outlaw Comanchero, Outlaw Riflemen, and Outlaw Pistolero by 35% and cost 2 less population
- Three Sisters - Age 4 Shipment that increases farm gather rate by 40% (currently replaces old ways)
- Aggressive policy now reduces the cost of Teepees by 50% but reduces their hitpoints by 33%, in addition to letting infantry build War Huts, Teepees, and Corrals
- Nomadic Expansion cost reduction reduced to 25% from 30%. Now additionally increases Teepee LOS by 5. Now available in Age 1
- Sioux now has access to the water dance shipment
- Town Dance moved to colonial age. Now lets Sioux build walls in any age (starting from colonial) and research bastion.
- Adoption train time reduction improved to -40% from -25% [ESOC]
- Onikare moved to Age 4 from Age 2; now additionally reduces Dog Soldier train time by 20% [thanks to gamevideo113]
- Marauders reworked to give Tashunke Prowlers +10x damage vs. Explorers and Mercenaries and +4x damage vs. Native Warriors
- 4 villager shipment increased to 5
- Scorched Earth Shipment added in Age IV. Increases Tashunke Prowler, Cetan Bow, and War Club siege damage by +50%. 



Iroquois:

Added in a 10% wood chopping bonus to villagers by default (this helps compensate for the new secondary civ bonus). 

Secondary civ bonus: economic buildings now generate resource trickles but are more expensive to construct.
- Market cost increased to 180 from 100; built limit set to 6; generates 0.6 Wood/s; HP increased by 25%
- Plantation cost increased to 600 from 500; build limit set to 8; generates 0.80 Gold/s; HP increased by 20%
- Farm cost increased to 480 from 400; build limit set to 10; generates 1.0 Food/s; HP increased by 20%

Crates of 200 F/W/C increased to 300 Food and 300 Wood.

Politician Reworks/Changes: Incorporating some of smackdown's buffs
- Wise Woman: Industrial Age ships 500 Food/400 Wood/400 Coin (up by 100 each); Imperial Age ships 800 Food/700 Wood/700 Coin (up by 200 food and 100 gold/wood)

- Secret Society Big Button cost reduced to 100 Wood/Gold from 200 Wood, 100 Gold.

[Garja] Aenna and Forest Prowler HP reduced to 100 from 110 

Mantlet: They're fantastic units, but their slow movement speed really hampers their use. Bumping it up to 4.0 makes them much more versatile units.
- Speed: Increased to 4.0 from 3.5

Ram: They're niche units, and the slow movement speed doesn't help. Normalizing it to 4 alongside mantlets makes Iro's army far more mobile
- Speed: Increased to 4.0 from 3.5

Tomahawk: though they get a lot of upgrades, they have a pretty terrible base attack for a musketeer (being slightly better than a rusket, without being cheaper) and are very expensive. 
- Ranged Damage increased to 20 from 19

Kanya: Since Iroquois don't have access to cannons in Age 3, I've given Kanya a multiplier vs siege troopers (Grens, Shinobi, Mantlets, etc.) to help compensate, especially since they have an artillery multiplier
- 1.50x AbstractSiegeTrooper damage multiplier added. 

Light Cannon: To account for the advanced artillery shipment, base range has been reduced, but now shadowtechs to original value in industrial.
- Range: Reduced to 28 from 32, shadowtechs by 4 in industrial age. 

Shipments:
- Tuscarora Support now ships 2 Warrior priests instead of medicine men
- 6 Musket Rider shipment increased to 7 (Terrible age IV shipment resourcewise)
- Age 4 Cavalry Combat shipment added. (helps with their mediocre lategame kanya)
- 2 Light Cannons changed into Iroquois Expeditionary Brigade. Ships 8 Tomahawks and 2 Light Cannons
- Age 3 Iroquois Expeditionary Force added. Ships 5 Tomahawks and 1 Light Cannon
- Advanced Market additionally reduces the cost of markets by 50% and increases build limit by 5.

- Advanced Artillery shipment added. Allows Iroquois to train light cannons in the fortress age. 
- War Houses now additionally increases Longhouse HP by 25%
- TEAM Cheap Outposts cost reduction increased to 60% from 30%



India:

Agra Fort: A very unbalanced wonder. Obscenely powerful for an age 2 building, yet terrible later on in the game. As a result damage has been nerfed to make it less formidable (letting siege infantry actually have a chance), and it's more powerful lategame if you delay building it in colonial
- HP: 5000; now scales up by 1000 when built each age, starting from Age IV (6k industrial, 7k imperial). NOTE: a colonial agra doesn't shadowtech to 7k from 5k. It must be built to transition to imperial for full value.
- Damage: Base damage reduced to 20 from 25. 
	-- Ranged attack now scales by 30 in fortress age and 25 when built each age thereafter (50 fortress, 75 industrial, 100 imperial). NOTE: a colonial agra doesn't shadowtech to 100 damage from 20. It must be built to transition to imperial for full value.
