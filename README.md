The goal of this mod is to provide a comprehensive tweaks and rebalances to all
existing civilizations to bring up the power level of weak/underused units
(Rajput/Skull Knights) and round out some lopsided army compositions.
Additionally, civs with some particularly weak playstyles have gotten 
additional bonuses to make them more interesting to play as. 

In order to achieve this, many units are being completely reworked. 

Branches:

Releases: Fixed Release. Has all of the features for that version of the mod.
Master: Latest "Stable" version. Shouldn't have game-breaking bugs, but balance is not perfect.
Development: Absolute latest. Could be broken or have key missing features. Use at your own discretion. 

Installation:

copy the /bin/data folder to your Age of Empires 3's program files directory.
On Linux, this should be ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Age of Empires
3. On Windows, it should be something like: Program Files
(x86)/Steam/Steamapps/common/Age of Empires 3
