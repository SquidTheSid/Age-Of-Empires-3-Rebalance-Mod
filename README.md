The goal of this mod is to provide a comprehensive unit rebalance to all
existing civilizations to bring up the power level of weak/underused units
(Rajput/Skull Knights) and round out some lopsided army compositions.

In order to achieve this, many units are being completely reworked. 

Installation:

Extract the protoy.xml, stringtabley.xml, and techtreey.xml files to your "Age
of Empires 3"/bin/data folder (make sure to backup existing files).
