# Age Of Empires 3: Overhauled

The goal of this mod is to provide a comprehensive tweaks and rebalances to all
existing civilizations to bring up the power level of weak/underused units
(Rajput/Skull Knights) and round out some lopsided army compositions.
Additionally, civs with some particularly weak playstyles have gotten 
additional bonuses to make them more interesting to play as. 

In order to achieve this, many units are being completely reworked.
