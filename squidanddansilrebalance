SquidTheSid & Dansil92's unit rebalance mod

#The goal of this mod is to rebalance the units of problematic civilizations. This is aimed to encourage greater unit diversity and bring underperforming units up to par by often giving them new/interesting roles.

General:
- All skirmisher/archers now possess a 0.75x multiplier against AbstractLightInfantry on top of AbstractCoyoteMan. This makes Coyote Runners and other light infantry more durable against them.
- Trading post HP reduced to 2000 from 3000; advanced trading post HP bonus reduced to 25% from 50%
- Ninja population cost reduced from 4 to 2 
- Pikemen (units with the AbstractPikeman tag) have +1.0 melee range to better chase down cavalry
- Crossbowmen ranged attack increased to 17 from 16, melee attack increased from 7 to 8, AbstractHeavyInfantry damage multiplier improved to 1.50x
- Fast Age up politicians (Messenger, Exiled Prince) now age up in 40 seconds instead of 30. Fortress Age takes 45 seconds instead of 40
- Wall HP reduced to 2000 from 3000

Non-wood trickle cards have been improved.
- Colbertism: Increased to 2 food/s up from 1.5
- Capitalism: Increased to 1.5 gold/s up from 1.25

Siege Trooper tag rework: This tag is very inconsistent, so I've reduced the number of arbitrary units on there (Shinobi, Puma Spearman, Mongol Scout) to primarily focus on units that mostly deal siege damage (Rams, Failiphants, Flamethrowers, etc.)

Native: 
- Tiger Claw's "AbstractInfantry" tag removed and replaced with "AbstractCoyoteMan"

Revolution bonuses rebalanced (thanks to Jotunir on ESOC):
- Argentina: Now ships 5 mortars (instead of 6)
- Haiti: Now ships 16 colonial milita on top of a 10% HP boost
- Chile: Now ships 7 Imperial Hussars (instead of 10)
- Columbia: No changes (Ironclad's buffed HP compensates, might add in fishing ships)
- Peru: All unit HP boost increased to 15% from 5%
- Brazil: Now ships 25 Blackwood Archers instead of 20
- Mexico: Now additionally ships 10 Outlaw Riflemen on top of 10 Outlaw Pistoleros and Riders. 
- US: Now ships 4 Gatling Guns on top of a 25% HP boost

Gatling gun: In RE, it's just a worse organ gun. I've buffed it to have parity with that.
- Damage: raised to 33 from 30
- LOS: increased to 30 from 26
- Range: increased to 26 from 24 

Halberdier: Great meatshields, but their slow movement speeds limits their utility. It's been raised to make them more versatile, alongside an armor buff to help them out. 
- Speed: increased to 4.5 from 4.0.
- Armor: Increased to 20% hand from 10% hand 

Imam/Priest: Do you ever see them? Healing as a mechanic in AoE3 is pretty terrible, so I'm making Priests cheaper and a bit faster to make them decent meatshields
- Cost: Reduced to 70F/G, down from 200 gold. Bounty adjusted accordingly (20 --> 14); Missionary cost reduced to 80W/G from 100W/G. Bounty adjusted accordingly (20 --> 16)

Aztec: 

Warrior Priest - no longer costs population (gives more flexibility for Aztec's lategame army) 

Jaguar Prowl Knight - The JPK is now a melee skirmisher, similar to India's Urumi, but without AoE. His heavy infantry tag has been removed, but he's much weaker vs. cavalry to compensate. 
- HP: Lowered to 200 from 230
- Armor: Changed from 10% melee to 20% ranged
- 0.75x multiplier vs cavalry and light infantry added (with a further 0.75x vs light infantry), 2.0x light cavalry multiplier/xpEagleKnight multipliers added
- Heavy infantry unit tag removed

Skull Knight - The Skull Knight is now a mini-cuirassier and is classified as light infantry. They're Aztec's shock troopers and their AoE cleave can carve through skirmishers with ease. To compensate for their increased speed, they have lower siege damage and no unit multipliers. 
- Armor: Changed from 20% melee to 20% ranged
- 3x Cavalry and 2x Light Infantry damage multipliers removed (no penalties/strengths vs. any unit now)
- Speed: Increased from 4 to 6.25
- Siege: Reduced to 20 damage from 72; now affected by Scorched Earth shipment
- Infantry and Heavy Infantry unit tags removed, Light Infantry and CoyoteMan unit tags added

Eagle Runner Knight - Due to the increased versatility of the Aztec army, ERKs have had their power levels slightly brought down. (Incorporating Garja's changes)
- Armor: Reduced from 30% ranged to 20% 
- Speed: Increased to 6.25 from 6.00

Arrow Knights - Incorporated ESOC changes
- Population: Reduced from 2 to 1
- Movement Speed: Increased from 3.75 to 4 

Puma Spearmen - Incorporated ESOC changes
- Siege trooper unit tag removed. 
- Light Infantry damage multiplier improved to 3.5x

Macehaultin - Incorporated ESOC changes
- Centeotl Support now additionally increases range and LOS by 2 each. 
- Centeotl Support now ships 11 Macehaultin instead of 18; cost reduced to 500 gold. 

Coyote Runner: Coyotes Struggle later on, so I've made their temple card cheaper to help them out. Due to unit tag changes, they should also be a bit more durable to skirmishers now. 
- Xipe Totec Support now ships 6 Coyote Runners instead of 11; cost reduced to 500 gold. 


Overall: Aztec's vanilla roster was heavily weighted in favor of anti-cav, with Jaguar Prowl Knights, Puma Spearmen, Skull Knights, and Eagle Runner Knights all fulfilling this role. Generally, a late-game Aztec player would build their army out of almost entirely ERKs due to their significant overall strength, leaving Skull Knights and JPK by the wayside. Now, Aztec have 2 proper cavalry units, 2 skirmisher units, 2 anti-cav units, and 1 artillery unit. 

Sioux :

Teepee: A very controversial building (given how ESOC added then removed an economic aura a la karni mata). I've decided to take iCourt's idea and make it buff all units.
- Cost: Reduced to 40W from 50, bounties adjusted accordingly (20/10 --> 16/8)
- HP: Increased to 500 from 300

Sioux get free bison every Age (4 colonial, 8 fortress, 16 industrial, 30 imperial)
- Wise woman politician now ships more bison (8,15,25, 40 up from 6,12,20,30) and grants a larger buff to hunting (20/30/40/50% up from 10/20/30/40%)

Sioux can now build regular walls in the Industrial Age (cannot be upgraded)
Sioux Infantry can now build Teepees by default (tba)
Sioux's town centers cost 400 wood instead of 500

Shipments: 
- Earth Bounty shipment now provides 0.65 Food, Wood, and Gold trickles instead of 0.65 Wood and Gold trickles
- Burnt Thigh Support Shipment now sends 8 Rifle Riders (up from 7) and 2 warrior priests instead of medicine men
- Lakota Support now ships 8 axe riders (up from 7) and 15 bison (up from 9)
- Nakota Support now ships 5 Dog Soldiers instead of 4
- San Arc Support no longer ships wood, but increases the hitpoints of all War Clubs by 20%
- Oglala Support no longer ships food, but increases the damage of all Cetan Bows by 20%
- Dakota Support now ships 6 Tashunke Prowlers (up from 5) and increases the hitpoints of all Tashunke Prowlers by 30% (up from 25%)
- Bandit Gang - Bandit Gang (Non-repeatable) renamed to Outlaw Combat and no longer ships units nor costs coin. Instead, it increases the HP/damage of Outlaw Comanchero, Outlaw Riflemen, and Outlaw Pistolero by 35% and reduced their population cost by 2
- Outlaw Loyalty - Age 2 shipment that reduces cost of Outlaws by 30% and reduces population cost by 2 (tba)
- Three Sisters - Age 4 Shipment that increases farm gather rate by 40% (currently replaces old ways)
- Cav combat cards affect Tashunke Prowlers by an extra 5% (for a total of 20%)
- Aggressive policy now reduces the cost of Teepees by 50% and build time by 40%, but reduces their hitpoints by 40%, in addition to letting infantry build War Huts and Corrals
- Nomadic Expansion cost reduction reduced to 25% from 30%, hitpoint increase reduced to 30% from 50%. Now additionally increases Teepee LOS by 4.

Bow Rider - They're pretty ridiculous on RE, so I've incorporated Garja's HP nerf
- HP: Reduced to 240 from 250

Tashunke Prowler - Arguably the worst and weirdest unit in the game. Their overall design is terrible, and the buff in numbers is a terrible mechanic. Combined with their stealth (which only carded coyote runners share) and AoE, and this is a unit that is massively conflicted in design. They've been buffed significantly across the board and have been given a new role to help round out a specific weakness of the Sioux. 
- HP: Increased to 200 from 170
- Armor: Ranged armor increased to 30% from 10%
- Damage: Base attack increased to 20 from 15
- 5x Hero, 5x mercenary, and 2.5x native unit damage multipliers added. 
- LOS increased to 18 from 12
- Marauders shipment additionally increased LOS by 6. 
- Cavalry Damage/Hitpoint shipments buff Tashunke Prowlers by 20% instead of 15 (like Chinese Flamethrowers)

War Club - War Clubs are the Sioux's equivalent of pikemen, except they're not particularly great vs. cavalry or buildings. Since Sioux have access to Bow Riders age 2, anti-cav isn't usually a problem, but the lack of siege is. Therefore, I've made them deal far more siege damage, in addition to being a bit tankier and hit harder. Now, they're roughly equivalent to the Aztec's Puma Spearmen, but with slightly less damage and slightly more HP
-HP: Increased from 120 to 140
- Damage: Base attack increased to 11 from 10
- Siege: Increased to 35 damage from 27

Cetan Bow: Incorporated ESOC Changes
- HP: Increased to 100 from 90
- Speed: Increased to 4.5 from 4.0


Overall, Tashunke Prowlers are now the cavalry equivalent of spies, but with a splash attack and an aura gimmick. They still require heavy resource investment to maximize, but they should be usable in small numbers, no longer being completely outclassed by the cheap steppe rider. While they might not see use in every game, they're no longer a joke unit. War Clubs help provide the raw siege damage that Sioux lacks early on, and Cetan Bows are more versatile archer units, especially with their reworked mercenary shipments. Outlaw units are situationally more useful in lategame now, thanks to a buffed repeatable Bandit Gang, and Outlaw Combat replacing the non repeatable variant (combining the effects of European's Wild West saloon tech and Dance Hall population reduction)

Iroquois (WIP):

Scouting Party Big Button cost changed from 500 food to 200 food/gold.

Mantlet: They're fantastic units, but their slow movement speed really hampers their use. Bumping it up to 4.0 makes them much more versatile units.
- Speed: Increased to 4.0 from 3.5

Ram: They're niche units, and the slow movement speed doesn't help. Normalizing it to 4 alongside mantlets makes Iro's army far more mobile
- Speed: Increased to 4.0 from 3.5

India (WIP):

Flail Elephants: Awful redundant units. needs a complete overhaul, but I've just given them some buffs in the meantime.
- Infantry multiplier increased to 3.0x from 1.5x
- Villager damage penalty removed. 
- Population Cost: Reduced to 4 from 3 (mansabdar reduced to 6)
- Speed: Increased to 4.5 from 4.0

Sepoy: The best colonial age musketeer. They're a bit too strong, I find, so their HP has been slightly lowered to adjust Town Center fire breakpoints (7 vills now 3 shot a sepoy instead of 8).
- HP: Lowered to 185 from 190

Rajput: Infamously terrible on vanilla, they're pretty much a worse version of Sepoy. To help them out, I've improved their anti-cavalry abilities and greatly buffed their siege damage to be on par with other pikemen units. 
- Siege: Increased to 25 damage up from 20
- Speed: Increased to 5.5 from 5.0 
- Cost: Food cost reduced by 20 to 80F

Siege Elephant: Siege elephants struggled greatly on vanilla due to being easily overwhelmed by infantry. With the removal of their light cav tag, they should be more versatile units.
- Light cavalry unit tag removed
- Population Cost: Reduced to 6 from 7
- Honored upgrade increases artillery multiplier to 3.5x from 2.5x
- Honored upgrade increases range to 30 from 28
- LOS increased to 34 from 29
- Removed villager damage penalty
- Mansabdar population cost reduced to 9 from 14

Mahout Lancer: In vanilla, Mahout are easily kited, making them very hard to use. They've been buffed to make them better at chasing down skirmishers.
- Population Cost: Reduced to 6 from 7
- Speed: Increased to 6.25 from 6
- Range: Melee range increased to 2
- Removed villager damage penalty
- Damage: Melee attack improved to 35 from 28
- Mansabdar population cost reduced to 9 from 14

Howdah: Howdah, much like Mahout, as slow and are population inefficient. They've been adjusted as such
- Population Cost: Reduced to 5 from 6
- Speed: Increased to 6 from 5.5
- Mansabdar population cost reduced to 8 from 12

Sowar: They're India's version of cossacks, but with a focus on countering skirms. However, they're paper thin, so I've made them a little beefier
- HP: Increased to 250 from 225 (might include ESOC's damage multipliers down the line or maybe slightly reduce speed and buff attack).

Japan:

- Ending Japanese isolation no longer has a permanent damage penalty 
- Meiji Restoration Tech now additionally ships 1 factory wagon and 4 Gatling Guns on ageup

Yabusame: An overall solid unit with ridiculously heavy gold macro. It's been rescaled to more in line with other dragoon units
- Cost: Rescaled to 80 food and 130 gold from 60 food and 150 gold. 

Samurai: Samurai have always been iffy anti-cav units, now they're just a generic melee unit without weird AoE or multipliers. 
- HP: Increased to 235 from 230
- Cost: Reduced to 50 food, 60 coin from 100/100, shipments adjusted accordingly, build bountry adjusted accordingly (20 --> 11)
- Train Points: Reduced to 36 from 45
- All multipliers removed
- AoE removed
- Population: Reduced to 1 from 2
- Siege Damage: Reduced to 42 from 67
- Sword Saint: No longer increases unit cost, but adds in a 0.8x damage multiplier vs infantry

Yojimbo shipment increased to 5 from 4.

France:

Cuirassier: It's not secret that Gendarmes are hilariously broken lategames, so instant spawning has been removed. Additionally, their base stats have been lowered to prevent the scaling issues. 
- HP: Reduced to 400 from 500
- Damage: Reduced to 24 from 30
- Cost: Food/Coin cost reduced to 130/130 from 150/150, trainpoints reduced to 50 from 60
- Thoroughbreds: No longer reduces train points or cost. Now increases Cuirassier health and damage by 25% each. 
- Bounty: reduced to 26 from 30

China:

Qiang Pikeman: They've got a terribly low light infantry multiplier for a pike, so I've gone ahead and fixed it
- Light Infantry damage multiplier increased to 3.5x from 2.25x

Changdao: Changao are exceptionally cost effective units. A bit too much so, with their melee death ball. Thus, they are now more specialized towards cavalry
- Damage: Reduced to 13 from 15
- Cavalry multiplier increased to 2.75x from 2.25x, Light Infantry multiplier increased to 2.0x from 1.5x

Flamethrower: They're solid units with great upgrades, but their slow speed and high population cost hurt their lategame usage.
- Speed: Improved to 4.5 from 4.25
- Population Cost: Reduced to 3 from 4
- 2 Flamethrower shipment now upgrades them to disciplined for free. 
- 4 Flamethrower shipment now upgrades them to be honored for free. 

Keshik: China's dragoon/cav archer option is quite pathetic due to its pitiful base health. They've been buffed to be more survivable vs. cav, especially with old han 2.0
- HP: Increased to 140 from 110
- Armor: Changed from 30% Ranged to 30% Melee
- Obstruction radius reduced to .65 from .79
- Now affected by reworked Old Han Reforms

- Speed: Increased to 7.25 from 6.75
- Obstruction radius reduced to .65 from .79

Russia:

- TEAM Cheap Priests shipment cost reduction improved to -65% from -50%.

Strelets: I've fixed a long-standing bug. In the code, Strelets got a 25% discount on gold and food costs. But since they cost wood instead of gold, they receive no discount for that. It's been fixed as such.
Cost: Wood cost reduced to 75 from 100

Spain:

New civ bonus: Shipments now additionally arrive 25% faster 

Crossbowmen: Due to Spain's focus on archaic units (Imperial Tercios), I've added Royal Guard and Imperial Upgrades for Crossbowmen.
- Added Ballestero Royal Guard and Imperial Ballestero upgrades.
