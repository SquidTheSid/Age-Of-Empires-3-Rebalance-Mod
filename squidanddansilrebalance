SquidTheSid & Dansil92's unit rebalance mod

#The goal of this mod is to rebalance the units of problematic civilizations. This is aimed to encourage greater unit diversity and bring underperforming units up to par by often giving them new/interesting roles.

General:
- All skirmisher/archers now possess a 0.75x multiplier against AbstractLightInfantry on top of AbstractCoyoteMan. This makes Coyote Runners and other light infantry more durable against them.

Native: 
- Tiger Claw's "AbstractInfantry" tag removed and replaced with "AbstractCoyoteMan"

Asian:
- Fixed gold gather rates at rice paddies (previously, this had a 0.9x multiplier for some reason)

Euro: 
- Grenadier's HeavyInfantry tag removed

Gatling gun: In RE, it's just a worse organ gun. I've buffed it to have parity with that.
- Damage: raised to 33 from 30
- LOS: increased to 30 from 26
- Range: increased to 26 from 24 

Halberdier: Great meatshields, but their slow movement speeds limits their utility. It's been raised to make them more versatile, alongside an armor buff to help them out. 
- Speed: increased to 4.5 from 4.0.
- Armor: Increased to 20% hand from 10% hand 

Aztec: 

Jaguar Prowl Knight - The JPK is now a melee skirmisher, similar to India's Urumi, but without AoE. His heavy infantry tag has been removed, but he's much weaker vs. cavalry to compensate. 
- HP: Lowered to 200 from 230
- Armor: Changed from 10% melee to 20% ranged
- 0.5x multiplier vs cavalry and light infantry added, 2.0x light cavalry multiplier added
- Heavy infantry unit tag removed

Skull Knight - The Skull Knight is now a mini-cuirassier and is classified as light infantry. They're Aztec's shock troopers and their AoE cleave can carve through skirmishers with ease. To compensate for their increased speed, they have lower siege damage and no unit multipliers. 
- Armor: Changed from 20% melee to 20% ranged
- 3x Cavalry and 2x Light Infantry damage multipliers removed (no penalties/strengths vs. any unit now)
- Speed: Increased from 4 to 6.25
- Siege: Reduced to 20 damage from 72; now affected by Scorched Earth shipment
- Infantry and Heavy Infantry unit tags removed, Light Infantry and CoyoteMan unit tags added

Eagle Runner Knight - Due to the increased versatility of the Aztec army, ERKs have had their power levels slightly brought down. (Incorporating Garja's changes)
- Armor: Reduced from 30% ranged to 20% 
- Speed: Increased to 6.25 from 6.00

Arrow Knights - Incorporated ESOC changes
- Population: Reduced from 2 to 1
- Movement Speed: Increased from 3.75 to 4 

Puma Spearmen - Incorporated ESOC changes
- Siege trooper unit tag removed. 
- Light Infantry damage multiplier improved to 3.5x

Macehaultin - Incorporated ESOC changes
- Centeotl Support now additionally increases range and LOS by 2 each. 
- Centeotl Support now ships 11 Macehaultin instead of 18; cost reduced to 500 gold. 

Coyote Runner: Coyotes Struggle later on, so I've made their temple card cheaper to help them out. Due to unit tag changes, they should also be a bit more durable to skirmishers now. 
- Xipe Totec Support now ships 6 Coyote Runners instead of 11; cost reduced to 500 gold. 


Overall: Aztec's vanilla roster was heavily weighted in favor of anti-cav, with Jaguar Prowl Knights, Puma Spearmen, Skull Knights, and Eagle Runner Knights all fulfilling this role. Generally, a late-game Aztec player would build their army out of almost entirely ERKs due to their significant overall strength, leaving Skull Knights and JPK by the wayside. Now, Aztec have 2 proper cavalry units, 2 skirmisher units, 2 anti-cav units, and 1 artillery unit. 

Sioux (WIP):

Tashunke Prowler - Arguably the worst and weirdest unit in the game. Their overall design is terrible, and the buff in numbers is a terrible mechanic. Combined with their stealth (which only carded coyote runners share) and AoE, and this is a unit that is massively conflicted in design. They've been buffed significantly across the board and have been given a new role to help round out a specific weakness of the Sioux. 
- HP: Increased to 200 from 170
- Armor: Ranged armor increased to 30% from 10%
- Damage: Base attack increased to 20 from 15
- Speed: Increased to 7 from 6.75
- 10x Hero, 5x mercenary, and 2.5x native unit damage multipliers added. 
- LOS increased to 18 from 12

War Club - War Clubs are the Sioux's equivalent of pikemen, except they're not particularly great vs. cavalry or buildings. Since Sioux have access to Bow Riders age 2, anti-cav isn't usually a problem, but the lack of siege is. Therefore, I've made them deal far more siege damage, in addition to being a bit tankier and hit harder. Now, they're roughly equivalent to the Aztec's Puma Spearmen, but with slightly less damage and slightly more HP
-HP: Increased from 120 to 140
- Damage: Base attack increased to 11 from 10
- Siege: Increased to 40 damage from 27

Cetan Bow: Incorporated ESOC Changes
- HP: Increased to 100 from 90
- Speed: Increased to 4.5 from 4.0

Overall, Tashunke Prowlers are now the cavalry equivalent of spies, but with a splash attack and an aura gimmick. They still require heavy resource investment to maximize, but they should be usable in small numbers, no longer being completely outclassed by the cheap steppe rider. While they might not see use in every game, they're no longer a joke unit. War Clubs help provide the raw siege damage that Sioux lacks early on, and Cetan Bows are more versatile archer units. 

Iroquois (WIP):

Mantlet: They're fantastic units, but their slow movement speed really hampers their use. Bumping it up to 4.0 makes them much more versatile units.
- Speed: Increased to 4.0 from 3.5

Ram: They're niche units, and the slow movement speed doesn't help. Normalizing it to 4 alongside mantlets makes Iro's army far more mobile
- Speed: Increased to 4.0 from 3.5

India (WIP):

Rajput: Infamously terrible on vanilla, they're pretty much a worse version of Sepoy. To help them out, I've improved their anti-cavalry abilities and greatly buffed their siege damage to be on par with other pikemen units. 
- Siege: Increased to 25 damage up from 20
- Speed: Increased to 5.5 from 5.0 
- Cost: Food cost reduced by 20 to 80F

Siege Elephant: Siege elephants struggled greatly on vanilla due to being easily overwhelmed by infantry. With the removal of their light cav tag, they should be more versatile units.
- Light cavalry unit tag removed
- Population Cost: Reduced to 6 from 7
- Honored upgrade increases artillery multiplier to 3.5x from 2.5x
- Honored upgrade increases range to 30 from 28
- LOS increased to 34 from 29
- Removed villager damage penalty
- Mansabdar population cost reduced to 9 from 14

Mahout Lancer: In vanilla, Mahout are easily kited, making them very hard to use. They've been buffed to make them better at chasing down skirmishers.
- Population Cost: Reduced to 6 from 7
- Speed: Increased to 6.25 from 6
- Range: Melee range increased to 2
- Removed villager damage penalty
- Mansabdar population cost reduced to 9 from 14

Howdah: Howdah, much like Mahout, as slow and are population inefficient. They've been adjusted as such
- Population Cost: Reduced to 5 from 6
- Speed: Increased to 6 from 5.5
- Mansabdar population cost reduced to 8 from 12

Sowar: They're India's version of cossacks, but with a focus on anti-skirmishers, like Naginata Riders. However, they cost too much population for what they do. 
- Population Cost: Reduced to 1 from 2

Japan:

- Ending Japanese isolation no longer has a permanent damage penalty 

Yabusame: An overall solid unit with ridiculously heavy gold macro. It's been rescaled to more in line with other dragoon units
- Cost: Rescaled to 100 food and 110 gold from 60 food and 150 gold. 

Samurai: Samurai have always been iffy cav units, now they're just a generic melee unit without weird AoE or multipliers. 
- HP: Increased to 235 from 230
- Cost: Reduced to 50 food, 60 coin from 100/100, shipments adjusted accordingly, build bountry adjusted accordingly (20 --> 12)
- Train Points: Reduced to 36 from 45
- All multipliers removed
- AoE removed
- Population: Reduced to 1 from 2
- Siege Damage: Reduced to 42 from 67
- Sword Saint: No longer increases unit cost, but adds in a 0.8x damage multiplier vs infantry

France:

Cuirassier: It's not secret that Gendarmes are hilariously broken lategames, so instant spawning has been removed. Additionally, their base stats have been lowered to prevent the scaling issues. 
- HP: Reduced to 400 from 500
- Damage: Reduced to 24 from 30
- Cost: Food/Coin cost reduced to 130/130 from 150/150, trainpoints reduced to 50 from 60
- Thoroughbreds: No longer reduces train points or cost. Now increases Cuirassier health and damage by 25% each. 
- Bounty: reduced to 27 from 30

China:

Qiang Pikeman: They've got a terribly low light infantry multiplier for a pike, so I've gone ahead and fixed it
- Light Infantry damage multiplier increased to 3.5x from 2.25x

Changdao: Changao are exceptionally cost effective units. A bit too much so, with their melee death ball. Thus, they are now more specialized towards cavalry
- Damage: Reduced to 13 from 15
- Cavalry multiplier increased to 2.75x from 2.25x, Light Infantry multiplier increased to 2.0x from 1.5x

Flamethrower: They're solid units with great upgrades, but their slow speed and high population cost hurt their lategame usage.
- Speed: Improved to 4.5 from 4.25
- Population Cost: Reduced to 3 from 4
- 2 Flamethrower shipment now upgrades them to disciplined for free. 
- 4 Flamethrower shipment now upgrades them to be honored for free. 

Keshik: China's dragoon/cav archer option is quite pathetic due to its pitiful base health. They've been buffed to be more survivable vs. cav, especially with old han 2.0
- HP: Increased to 140 from 110
- Armor: Changed from 30% Ranged to 30% Melee
- Obstruction radius reduced to .65 from .79
- Now affected by reworked Old Han Reforms

Steppe Rider: China's age 2 raider does not scale well. To help old han 2.0 now affects them
- Speed: Increased to 7.25 from 6.75
- Obstruction radius reduced to .65 from .79
- Now affected by reworked Old Han Reforms

Banner Armies:
- Iron Cap Prince now ships 12 changdao, 3 flamethrowers, and upgrades flamethrowers to disciplined. 
- Beiyang Army food cost reduced to 750 from 1000
- Every Victorious Army food cost reduced to 1500 from 2000
- New Army food cost removed
- Old Han Reforms food cost removed. Army costs reduced to a 20% increase from 50%. Now affects Steppe Riders and Keshiks. Upgrades reduced from 100% to 50% HP/Attack
- Mandarin Duck Squad now ships 10 Chu Ko Nus, up from 8
- Emperor's Army now ships 10 hand mortars, up from 8

Dutch:

Halberdier: 
- Military Reforms speed increase reduced to 10% from 20%; infantry penalty reduced to 20% from 25%

Portugal:

Bestieros: 2400 for crossbowmen? Oof.
- Cost: Reduced to 800 wood from 2400
- Now ships 12 crossbowmen instead of 22
